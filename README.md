# Rock

Rock is a Grails web application to record your progress in music games like Rocksmith 2014.

This is version 0.2, code is alpha level.

### TODOs

* tests
* Work on user interface
* Fix issues (see: https://github.com/dewarim/rock/issues )
* documentation
* test server

## Installation

### Requirements

* Grails 2.4.3 - http://grails.org
* Java JDK 8 - required by Grails, see installation instructions thereof

### Install from source

To run the application locally:

* Install Grails 2.4.3 or later
* Download the code from GitHub, either via git or as a ZIP archive ( https://github.com/dewarim/rock/archive/master.zip )
* Unpack code if needed
* On Windows: run cmd.exe via start menu
* cd to the rock directory
* type 'grails run-app'

Note: this will not save your data (scores, new bands or songs) upon exiting. You need a "real" database and application for that,
or some configuration that stores your data in a file database.
